# üîê Integrity Box

**Integrity Box** is a simple web tool I created to help people access valid Android Keybox files, completely for free.

## ‚ùó Why I Built This

A few days ago, over **500+ keyboxes were leaked** and started circulating in various Telegram groups and channels. 

Unfortunately, I witnessed many sellers taking those free keyboxes and **selling them to innocent users**, pretending they were premium or private. Some even started offering **monthly subscriptions**, like "$100/month for valid keyboxes," which is simply a scam.

That is the main reason I created this repository. I wanted to make sure **no one gets scammed** for something that is already free and publicly available.

The same motivation was behind my **Integrity Box Magisk Module**. I believe in keeping things open and accessible. If something is free, it should stay free.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> There is no such thing as a "private keybox." No one can build a keybox.  
> If someone claims they have private or custom keyboxes, **they are lying and trying to scam you. Please block them.**

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Final Words

I created this project to help others avoid being tricked. Everything here will always remain free. If this project helped you or saved you from getting scammed, then it has served its purpose.

**Stay safe, and thank you for visiting.**
